# A note of the toml file format. Toml requires that all values are defined before
# any tables. This means that any key pair tables / map needs to be defined after
# all values relating to the root of the file.
#
# An example of this would be `remote`. Remote takes in the upstream name and url.
# This must be defined after all global values like `name` and `tags`. Values coming
# after the `[remote]` tag belong to remote and not the global value table.

# Here are the values of a project
#
# - name               = The name of the project. This should be the same as the filename
# - after_clone        = A string that will be run as a command after cloning the project
# - after_work         = A string that will be run as a commadn after work operation
# - override_path      = Override the default path of the project when the workspace path is
#                        resolved. If the path is relative it is relative to the workspace
#                        path. This will override any tag values. {workspace}/{path}/{name}.
# - override_name      = Overrides the default name of the project when the workspace path is resolved
# - bare               = State if the project is a bare git repository. If it is not defined
#                        the default is false
# - tags               = A list of strings that contains the name of all tags that apply to it
# - additional_remotes = A list of additional remotes that are related to the project
# - remote:            = The origin remote of the project. A remote as an upstream name and
#                        a url path to the remote
#
