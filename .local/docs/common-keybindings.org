*** Thoughts behind subgroups/key-chaining/emacs-coords
    A way to group similar actions around a key that pnumonicly makes it easy to remember.
    To access the subgroup should be `mod + [key]` to enter the subgroup

**** To enter the subgroup is mod + [key]
**** More common operations in the mod group are accessable with a combinaration of [S, C, A]
**** The key that is defined as the subgroup should also be mapped so that you can press with or without mod
